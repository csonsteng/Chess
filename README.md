# Chess
I was bored one weekend and decided I wanted to try to make a chess engine. It ended up taking me like a weekend and a half to get it to its current state. I started just using some primitive Unity shapes as my pieces but ended up downloading a set of models to plug in.

It is fully functioning with all chess rules with the exception of pawn promotion (I just never got around to adding it in). It is also able to recreate any board state using FEN (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forsyth%E2%80%93Edwards_Notation)

It does have a very primitive AI which I developed without consulting typical approaches to chess AI (probably a mistake but it was a fun challenge)
